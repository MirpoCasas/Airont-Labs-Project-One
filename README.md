## Hi! Welcome

This is my project for Airont Labs' Bootcamp for FrontEnd Devs.

It's a page that uses The Movie DB API to fetch movies and display them in popularity order.

This project uses JSON server Auth for a mock up Backend to use Log in functions. When copying the repo, `npm start` should be ran on console to start the server. 
Only then, will login functions work.

The test credentials that can be used are:


User: test1@fakemail.com
Pass: FakePass123.
